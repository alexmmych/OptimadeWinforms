# Optimade

Optimade is a modern rebuild of a C# WinForms application that utilizes CefSharp to load an HTML site. The main goal of Optimade was to create a rounded rectangle window even before Windows 11 was announced. Today, it serves as a modernized version of the original application, maintained for safekeeping.
